The primary background colors are soft off-whites and pale blues, creating a calm and inviting canvas. Text and interactive elements predominantly use a deep navy blue, ensuring strong contrast and readability. Accent colors in subtle pastel purple and yellow appear in small UI elements, adding gentle vibrancy without overwhelming the design. Typography is geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings paired with lighter, well-spaced body text to enhance clarity and hierarchy. The layout employs modular grids with generous negative space, balancing text and iconography in a harmonious, user-friendly manner. Buttons are solid, rounded rectangles with dark backgrounds and white text, emphasizing clear calls to action. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, approachability, and efficiency, making it highly adaptable for educational platforms, professional services, and technology brands seeking a clean and trustworthy online presence.",

    "designSummary": "This brand design embraces a minimalist and modern aesthetic characterized by spacious layouts, clean typography, and a restrained pastel color palette. The primary background colors are soft off-whites and pale blues, creating a calm and inviting canvas. Text and interactive elements predominantly use a deep navy blue, ensuring strong contrast and readability. Accent colors in subtle pastel purple and yellow appear in small UI elements, adding gentle vibrancy without overwhelming the design. Typography is geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings paired with lighter, well-spaced body text to enhance clarity and hierarchy. The layout employs modular grids with generous negative space, balancing text and iconography in a harmonious, user-friendly manner. Buttons are solid, rounded rectangles with dark backgrounds and white text, emphasizing clear calls to action. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, approachability, and efficiency, making it highly adaptable for educational platforms, professional services, and technology brands seeking a clean and trustworthy online presence.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'background' color as the primary canvas for all pages to maintain a clean and calm atmosphere. The 'primary' color should be reserved for main text, headings, and key interactive elements such as buttons and links, paired with 'primaryForeground' for text on these elements to ensure readability. The 'secondary' color and its 'secondaryForeground' are ideal for subtle UI accents, secondary buttons, and category tags, providing gentle contrast without overpowering the primary content. Custom colors like 'softYellowAccent' and 'lightPurpleAccent' are best used sparingly for highlighting informational badges, icons, or subtle background gradients to add visual interest while preserving the minimalist tone. This palette ensures accessibility and visual harmony, supporting a professional and approachable brand presence.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color (#1E254E) on 'background' (#F7F9FF) achieves excellent contrast exceeding WCAG AA standards for both normal and large text. Buttons using 'primary' with 'primaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) also meet AAA contrast requirements. The 'secondary' color (#A59FE6) on 'background' provides sufficient contrast for UI accents and secondary text, meeting WCAG AA for large text. Custom colors 'softYellowAccent' and 'lightPurpleAccent' are used in small UI elements and backgrounds where contrast requirements are less stringent but should be paired with 'primary' or 'primaryForeground' text to maintain readability and accessibility compliance."
